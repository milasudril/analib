# Analib Not A  LIBrary

ANALib is intended to be a collection of small, independent modules, that are reusable, but too small to live in dedicated repos. You may think of it as Rosetta Code, but with more focus on ready-to-use wrappers instead of being a collection of recepies. Examples of that would be RAII-style C++ wrapper classes for families of C functions. You may also find csv files containing useful constants, such as mathematical and physical constants.

## Usage

To use pieces of ANALib it is recommendend to simply clone the repo, and configure your build system/toolchain so it can find and use the files.
